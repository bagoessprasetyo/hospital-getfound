## 3. Core Process

**Public User Flow:**
Users visit the homepage and interact with the chat-style search interface by describing their health needs or specifying requirements. The system processes their input and displays relevant hospitals on the listing page. Users can apply additional filters to refine results, then click on hospital cards to view detailed information including associated doctors and their availability status.

**Patient Flow:**
Registered patients can search for doctors by specialty or hospital, view doctor profiles with availability calendars, and book appointments by selecting available time slots. They can manage their appointments through the patient dashboard, view appointment history, and update their profile information.

**Doctor Flow:**
Doctors log in to manage their availability by setting working hours, creating time slots, and updating their availability status. They can view their appointment schedule, update their profile information, and manage their association with multiple hospitals.

**Admin Flow:**
Administrators access the admin dashboard to view comprehensive system statistics including hospitals, doctors, and appointments. They can navigate to hospital management to perform CRUD operations on hospital records, access doctor management to create doctor profiles and assign them to multiple hospitals, and oversee the appointment system. The system maintains data integrity through proper relationship modeling.
